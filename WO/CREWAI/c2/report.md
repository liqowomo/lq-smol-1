# Techniques for Finding High-Value Bug Bounties in Web Applications

## Focus on Logic Flaws

Business logic vulnerabilities are often overlooked but can have a significant impact, leading to substantial bounty payouts. These flaws stem from inconsistencies in how an application handles user roles, validates data, or manages state transitions.  They deviate from the expected business rules and allow attackers to manipulate the application's intended functionality.

**Key areas to target:**

* **Privilege Escalation:**  Attempt to perform actions reserved for higher-privileged users.  Test for scenarios where a regular user can gain administrative access, modify other user accounts, or access restricted data.
* **Purchase Logic Bypass:** Look for ways to manipulate pricing, discounts, or the checkout process to obtain goods or services for free or at a reduced price.  This includes manipulating quantities, coupons, or payment methods.
* **Reward System Manipulation:**  If the application has a points, rewards, or loyalty program, try to manipulate the system to gain an unfair advantage.  This might involve artificially inflating points balances, redeeming rewards multiple times, or transferring points to another account.
* **Workflow Bypass:**  Examine multi-step processes like account creation, password resets, or content submissions.  Look for ways to skip steps, bypass validation, or manipulate the flow to achieve an unauthorized outcome.

**Example:** An e-commerce site might allow users to apply multiple coupons by manipulating the HTTP request. If the logic doesn't correctly handle cumulative discounts, this could lead to a significant financial loss for the business.


## Target API Endpoints

APIs are the core of modern web applications, often handling sensitive data and functionality.  Targeting APIs can reveal critical vulnerabilities.

**Techniques:**

* **Fuzzing:** Use fuzzing tools to send malformed or unexpected inputs to API endpoints. This can reveal vulnerabilities like input validation errors, buffer overflows, or denial-of-service conditions.
* **Parameter Manipulation:** Modify API request parameters, including headers, query strings, and body data.  Try changing data types, injecting special characters, or omitting required fields.
* **Authentication Bypass:**  Attempt to access API endpoints without proper authentication or with manipulated authentication tokens.
* **Unauthorized Data Access:** Test for access control vulnerabilities that allow retrieval of sensitive data from other users or unauthorized resources.
* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  Try to force the server to make requests to internal or external resources that it shouldn't be able to access.


## Exploit Race Conditions

Race conditions arise from concurrent access and modification of shared resources, creating unpredictable behavior.

**Target Areas:**

* **Checkout Processes:** During online purchases, race conditions can allow users to purchase multiple items for the price of one or manipulate inventory levels.
* **Funds Transfers:** In financial applications, race conditions can enable double spending or unauthorized transfer of funds.
* **Account Updates:** Simultaneous update requests can lead to data corruption or inconsistency in user account information.

**Exploitation:** Requires carefully timed requests to exploit the small window of vulnerability during concurrent operations.


## Chain Multiple Vulnerabilities

Combining seemingly minor vulnerabilities can create high-severity exploits.

**Example:** Chaining a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability with a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability can allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of another user.  A reflected XSS could be used to inject a CSRF payload, forcing the victim to perform an action when they visit a malicious link.


## Dive Deep into Authentication and Authorization

Weaknesses in authentication and authorization are prevalent and often have serious consequences.

**Focus Areas:**

* **Authentication Bypass:** Look for ways to bypass login mechanisms, exploit weak password policies, or manipulate authentication tokens.
* **Authorization Flaws:** Test for vulnerabilities that allow users to access functionalities or data they are not authorized to access.  Focus on horizontal and vertical privilege escalation.
* **Insecure Implementation of OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect:** Examine OAuth and OpenID implementations for flaws in token handling, redirect URLs, or consent flows.


## Explore Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)

SSTI allows injecting malicious code into server-side templates, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Approach:** Look for areas where user input is reflected within templates, and attempt to inject template syntax or code to manipulate the server-side rendering process.


## Leverage Insecure Direct Object References (IDORs)

IDORs occur when applications expose internal object references (e.g., database keys) without proper access controls.

**Exploitation:** Manipulate parameters that represent object references (e.g., user IDs, file names) to access data belonging to other users.


## Target WebSockets and Real-Time Features

WebSockets and real-time features introduce unique security vulnerabilities.

**Look for:**

* **Unauthenticated Access:** Test whether WebSocket connections can be established without proper authentication.
* **Message Forgery:**  Attempt to forge WebSocket messages to impersonate other users or send unauthorized commands.
* **Injection Vulnerabilities:**  Check for injection vulnerabilities within WebSocket messages, similar to traditional web application vulnerabilities.


## Understand the Business Impact

Focus on vulnerabilities with the greatest business impact to maximize bounty payouts.

**High-Impact Vulnerabilities:**

* **Data Breaches:** Exposing sensitive user data.
* **Financial Loss:** Enabling fraud, theft, or manipulation of financial transactions.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Negative publicity and loss of user trust.
* **Disruption of Service:**  Denial-of-service attacks or disruptions to critical business operations.
