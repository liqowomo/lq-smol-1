# Techniques for Finding High-Value Bug Bounties in Web Applications

This report details techniques and strategies for identifying high-impact vulnerabilities in web applications, suitable for bug bounty hunters and security researchers.

## Focus on Logic Flaws

Business logic vulnerabilities are often overlooked by automated scanners because they are specific to the application's intended functionality.  These flaws can have a significant impact, potentially allowing attackers to manipulate core business processes.  Key areas to investigate include:

* **Workflow Manipulation:** Analyze how the application handles multi-step processes like user registration, order placement, or password resets. Look for ways to bypass steps, manipulate data flow, or alter the intended sequence of actions.
* **Role-Based Logic Flaws:**  Examine how user roles and permissions are implemented. Test for privilege escalation by manipulating parameters related to user roles or exploiting inconsistencies in access control checks.
* **Data Validation and Consistency:**  Focus on how the application handles user-supplied data. Look for inconsistencies in data validation logic, which might allow attackers to manipulate data types, bypass input sanitization, or inject malicious code.
* **Financial Transactions:** If the application handles financial transactions, scrutinize every aspect of the process, including currency conversions, discounts, refunds, and reward point systems.  Look for ways to manipulate these calculations for financial gain.


## Target API Endpoints

APIs are a primary attack surface in modern web applications.  Thorough API testing is crucial for uncovering high-impact vulnerabilities.  Recommended techniques include:

* **API Documentation Review:** Carefully review API documentation for inconsistencies, undocumented endpoints, or hints about potential vulnerabilities.
* **Intercept and Analyze API Requests:** Use tools like Burp Suite or Postman to intercept and modify API requests. Analyze how the API handles different data inputs, error conditions, and authentication mechanisms.
* **Insecure Direct Object References (IDORs):** Test for IDOR vulnerabilities by manipulating parameters in API requests that reference internal objects.  Look for unauthorized access to data belonging to other users.
* **Broken Authentication:** Examine API authentication mechanisms for weaknesses, such as weak API keys, insufficient token validation, or bypasses of authentication checks.
* **Excessive Data Exposure:** Analyze API responses for excessive data exposure. Look for instances where the API returns more information than necessary, potentially leaking sensitive data.


## In-Depth Authentication and Authorization Testing

Authentication and authorization flaws can have severe consequences.  Testing should go beyond basic checks and include:

* **Session Management Flaws:**  Test for vulnerabilities like session fixation, session hijacking, and insecure cookie handling.
* **Weak Password Policies:** Analyze password policies for weaknesses such as short minimum lengths, lack of complexity requirements, or insufficient account lockout mechanisms.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Bypass:** If MFA is implemented, attempt to bypass it through techniques like SIM swapping, exploiting vulnerabilities in MFA implementations, or social engineering.
* **Horizontal and Vertical Privilege Escalation:**  Test for both horizontal privilege escalation (accessing resources belonging to another user with the same privilege level) and vertical privilege escalation (gaining access to resources reserved for higher privilege levels).


## Explore Cutting-Edge Technologies

New technologies introduce new attack vectors.  Staying ahead of the curve is essential for finding high-value bugs:

* **WebAssembly (Wasm):** Research potential vulnerabilities related to Wasm execution, memory management, and interaction with JavaScript.
* **GraphQL:** Explore GraphQL endpoints for vulnerabilities like introspection abuse, denial-of-service attacks, and injection vulnerabilities.
* **Serverless Functions:**  Analyze serverless functions for vulnerabilities related to authentication, authorization, resource limits, and function invocation.
* **Blockchain Integrations:** If the application integrates with blockchain technology, investigate potential vulnerabilities related to smart contracts, transaction handling, and key management.


## Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Cloud Environments

Cloud environments present unique opportunities for SSRF attacks.  Focus on:

* **Cloud Metadata Services:**  Attempt to access cloud metadata services from the application server to retrieve sensitive information about the cloud environment.
* **Internal APIs:**  Explore ways to leverage SSRF to access internal APIs and services within the cloud environment, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data breaches.


## Race Conditions

Race conditions are challenging to identify but can have significant consequences.  Focus on areas like:

* **Funds Transfer:**  Look for race conditions that might allow attackers to double-spend funds or manipulate transaction amounts.
* **Order Processing:**  Explore race conditions related to order placement, inventory updates, and order fulfillment.
* **Inventory Management:**  Investigate potential race conditions that could lead to incorrect inventory counts, allowing attackers to purchase items that are supposedly out of stock.


## Web Cache Poisoning

Web cache poisoning can impact a large number of users.  Target vulnerabilities like:

* **HTTP Header Injection:** Attempt to inject malicious HTTP headers into cached responses, potentially redirecting users to malicious websites or injecting malicious scripts.
* **Incorrect Cache Configuration:**  Look for misconfigurations in caching mechanisms that might allow attackers to poison the cache or bypass cache controls.
* **Cache Key Manipulation:**  Explore ways to manipulate cache keys to force the cache to serve poisoned responses.


## Prototype Pollution

Prototype pollution can lead to various attacks, including DoS and RCE.  Focus on:

* **JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**  Analyze commonly used JavaScript libraries and frameworks for potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
* **Object Manipulation:**  Look for ways to manipulate the prototype chain of objects to inject malicious properties or modify existing ones.



## Automated Tooling for Recon and Vulnerability Scanning

Leverage automated tools to enhance efficiency:

* **Nuclei:** Use Nuclei for targeted vulnerability scanning based on pre-defined templates.
* **Burp Suite Professional:** Utilize Burp Suite's features for automated scanning, request interception, and vulnerability analysis.
* **Custom Scripts:** Develop custom scripts to automate specific tasks, such as subdomain enumeration, directory brute-forcing, or vulnerability checking.


## Continuous Learning and Community Engagement

Staying current with the latest security research and engaging with the community is crucial.  Focus on:

* **Security Research:**  Follow security blogs, research papers, and vulnerability disclosures to learn about new attack techniques and vulnerabilities.
* **Capture the Flag (CTF) Competitions:** Participate in CTF competitions to hone your skills and learn new techniques in a practical environment.
* **Bug Bounty Community:** Engage with the bug bounty community through forums, online communities, and conferences to share knowledge and learn from other researchers.
