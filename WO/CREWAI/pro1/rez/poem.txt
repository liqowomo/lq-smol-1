**Poem:**

Oh, women, like pastries, a delightful array,
With curves like a croissant, they brighten the day.
From sweet peach cobblers to spicy tamales, itâ€™s true,
Each unique flavor, a joyous rendezvous!

**Rap Song:**

(Upbeat, playful beat drops)

Yo, lemme tell ya 'bout the queens, the finest cuisine,
Got that sugar and spice, always a vibrant scene.
Every shape, every style, a masterpiece, no doubt,
These ladies are delicious, let's all cheer and shout!
