# High-Paying Bug Bounty Vulnerabilities Report

This report details ten of the highest-paying vulnerabilities commonly found in bug bounty programs. Each section includes information on how to identify the vulnerability, example code snippets for testing, and mitigation strategies.

## 1. Remote Code Execution (RCE)

**Description:** RCE allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the target server, giving them complete control. This is considered one of the most critical vulnerabilities.

**How to Find:**

* **User Input Handling:** Analyze how the application handles user-supplied data, especially in areas where system commands are constructed.
* **File Uploads:** Examine file upload functionalities for weaknesses that allow uploading and executing malicious scripts.
* **Deserialization:** Investigate how the application deserializes data, as insecure deserialization can lead to RCE.
* **Command Injection:** Look for instances where user input is directly incorporated into shell commands.

**Example (PHP Command Injection):**

```php
<?php
$command = $_GET['cmd'];
system($command); // Vulnerable to command injection
?>
```

In this example, unsanitized user input from the `cmd` parameter is passed directly to the `system()` function, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands.

**Mitigation:**

* **Sanitize User Inputs:** Rigorously sanitize all user-supplied data before using it in any system calls or code execution contexts.
* **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection, which can sometimes lead to RCE.
* **Avoid Direct System Calls:** Avoid using functions like `system()`, `exec()`, `passthru()`, etc., unless absolutely necessary. If they are required, implement robust input validation and escaping.


## 2. SQL Injection

**Description:** SQL injection allows attackers to manipulate database queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to data, modifying data, or even taking control of the database server.

**How to Find:**

* **Test Input Fields:** Inject SQL syntax into input fields to see if the application returns database errors or unexpected results.
* **Error Messages:** Analyze error messages for clues about the database structure or query syntax.
* **Automated Tools:** Utilize tools like `sqlmap` to automate the testing process.

**Example (SQL Injection in Python):**

```python
import sqlite3
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'"  # Vulnerable
conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute(query)
```

This example demonstrates a vulnerable query construction where user-supplied input (`username`) is directly concatenated into the SQL query string.

**Mitigation:**

* **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent user input from being interpreted as SQL code.
* **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize user inputs to remove or escape special characters relevant to SQL syntax.


## 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Description:** XSS enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal cookies, hijack sessions, or redirect users to malicious websites.

**How to Find:**

* **Input Fields:** Inject HTML and JavaScript code into input fields, especially those that display user-generated content.
* **Reflected and Stored XSS:** Focus on areas where user input is immediately reflected back (reflected XSS) or stored and later displayed (stored XSS).

**Example (Reflected XSS):**

```html
<p>Hello, <?php echo $_GET['name']; ?></p>  <!-- Vulnerable -->
```

Here, the `name` parameter from the URL is directly echoed without proper escaping, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.


**Mitigation:**

* **Encode User Outputs:** Encode all user-supplied data before displaying it on the web page. Use appropriate encoding based on the context (HTML encoding, JavaScript encoding, etc.).
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded, mitigating the impact of XSS attacks.
* **Templating Engines:** Use secure templating engines that automatically handle escaping of user inputs.

## 4. Authentication Bypass

**Description:** Authentication bypass vulnerabilities allow attackers to gain access to protected resources without valid credentials.

**How to Find:**

* **Analyze Authentication Logic:** Thoroughly review the application's authentication logic for flaws, such as weak password requirements, logic errors, or insecure session management.
* **Weak Passwords:** Test for weak or default passwords.
* **Brute-Forcing:** Attempt brute-force attacks to identify weak password policies.
* **Logic Errors:** Look for logic errors in authentication flows that might allow bypassing the authentication process.

**Example (Insecure Comparison):**

```javascript
if (password == "secret") { // Vulnerable - type coercion
    // Grant access
}
```

This example shows a vulnerable comparison using `==` in JavaScript, which can lead to type coercion issues and potentially bypass authentication.

**Mitigation:**

* **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies requiring a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA to add an extra layer of security to the authentication process.
* **Secure Comparison Methods:** Use strict equality comparison operators (e.g., `===` in JavaScript) to prevent type coercion vulnerabilities.

## 5. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Description:** SSRF vulnerabilities allow attackers to force a server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources.  This can be used to access internal services, scan internal networks, or even bypass firewalls.

**How to Find:**

* **URL Fetching Functionality:** Identify functionalities that fetch content from user-supplied URLs. Pay close attention to functions like `file_get_contents()`, `curl`, or similar functionalities in different programming languages.

**Example (Vulnerable PHP Code):**

```php
$url = $_GET['url'];
$content = file_get_contents($url);  // Vulnerable
```

This code snippet demonstrates a vulnerable implementation where a user-supplied URL is directly used with `file_get_contents()`.

**Mitigation:**

* **Validate and Sanitize URLs:**  Strictly validate and sanitize user-supplied URLs before using them in any server-side requests.
* **Restrict Allowed Protocols and Domains:** Whitelist allowed protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) and domains to prevent access to internal resources or unauthorized external services.
* **Network Segmentation:** Implement network segmentation to isolate internal services and limit the impact of potential SSRF attacks.


## 6. XML External Entity (XXE) Injection

**Description:** XXE injection exploits vulnerabilities in XML parsers. Attackers can include external entities in XML documents, potentially leading to data disclosure, server-side request forgery (SSRF), denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and in some cases, remote code execution (RCE).

**How to Find:**

* **XML Parsers:** Identify areas where the application processes XML data. Test these parsers with specially crafted XML documents containing external entities.

**Mitigation:**

* **Disable External Entity Processing:** The primary mitigation is to configure XML parsers to disable the processing of external entities.


## 7. Insecure Deserialization

**Description:** Insecure deserialization vulnerabilities arise when applications deserialize untrusted data. This can lead to remote code execution (RCE), denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, or other critical security breaches.

**How to Find:**

* **Analyze Serialized Data Handling:** Examine how the application handles serialized data. Look for instances where user-supplied serialized data is deserialized without proper validation or sanitization.
* **Testing Tools:** Tools like ysoserial can generate payloads that can be used to test for deserialization vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation:**

* **Avoid Deserializing User-Supplied Data:**  Whenever possible, avoid deserializing data that comes directly from user input.
* **Safe Deserialization Libraries:** If deserialization is unavoidable, use safe deserialization libraries or implement robust validation mechanisms to prevent exploitation.

## 8. Business Logic Errors

**Description:** Business logic errors are flaws in the application's logic that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access, manipulate application functionality, or perform other malicious actions.  These errors are often specific to the application's business rules.

**How to Find:**

* **Examine Application Workflow:** Carefully analyze the application's workflow, paying attention to how different functionalities interact and how data is processed. Look for inconsistencies, unexpected behavior, or logic gaps that could be exploited.
* **Think Like an Attacker:**  Try to think outside the box and anticipate how a malicious user might try to manipulate the application's logic to achieve their goals.


## 9. Access Control Issues (Horizontal/Vertical Privilege Escalation)

**Description:** Access control vulnerabilities allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to resources or functionalities beyond their intended permissions. This includes both horizontal privilege escalation (accessing resources belonging to other users at the same privilege level) and vertical privilege escalation (gaining higher-level privileges).

**How to Find:**

* **Test User Roles and Permissions:** Systematically test different user roles and permissions to identify weaknesses in access control mechanisms.  Try to access resources or perform actions that should be restricted to certain roles.


## 10. Information Disclosure

**Description:** Information disclosure vulnerabilities unintentionally reveal sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, internal system details, source code, or user data.

**How to Find:**

* **Analyze Server Responses:** Examine server responses, including HTTP headers and error messages, for any leaked information.
* **Source Code Review (if available):** If source code is accessible (e.g., in open-source projects), review it for hardcoded credentials or other sensitive information.
* **Configuration Files:**  Examine configuration files for exposed data.
* **Error Messages:** Pay attention to error messages, which may sometimes reveal internal system details or paths.
