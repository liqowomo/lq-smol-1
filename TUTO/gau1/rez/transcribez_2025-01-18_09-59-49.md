This is a humorous audio clip of a person complaining about their missing pizza.  They dramatically describe their pepperoni and mushroom pizza being abducted by little green men in a UFO, complete with an over-the-top account of seeing the UFO hovering over their roof.  The speaker demands answers, questioning whether the aliens paid for the pizza, whether they tipped, and, most importantly, when they can expect a refund or a free replacement pizza delivered by rocket ship.  The ending is abruptly cut off mid-sentence, adding to the comedic effect.
